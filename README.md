# learning_to_speak_python
A course I am putting together to make the quarantine more productive for people from across diverse backgrounds. The goal is to teach them to communicate with computers using python.

**FAQs**

Q) How do I run the ipynb file?

A) Create an account on colab.research.google.com. Then, When you click on the above link to see the code, it will take you the notebook on github. That has a button up top which says "open in colab". That should work!
